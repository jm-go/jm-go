# Hello, I'm Jo 👋

## 📚 About Me
I have a degree in Psychology and Criminology from Aberystwyth University. I am pursuing an online, part-time MSc in Computer Science at the University of Bath.

Transitioning into the tech industry, I'm excited to blend my background in psychology with my growing technical skills to contribute to meaningful and impactful projects.
